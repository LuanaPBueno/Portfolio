#JigglyStar

A game create in group for a discipline in PUC-RJ university. For the game we used Pygame (python), adding buttons, menu, a help page and etc.

To better understand the organization of this repository, it's important to realize that all the files with ".png" extensions were images we used as elements in the game called JigglyStar. Additionally, even though there are different maps representing dictionaries to build the game's environment, the most important file for running the game is "main."

In the folder: images you can see images of the game.
