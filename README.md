# Portfolio

A place where you can see my main codes. Inside every folder there is a README with the infos and a link to the original repository of that project and you can acess images of the project on the folder images inside each project. But if you don't want to get out of this repository to another, you don't need to, all the codes and images you need are inside the folders.
